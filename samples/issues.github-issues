Because the GH issues web interface does not have an automatic draft saving system (like Outlook/Exchange365/Office365 Word/Gmail), I'm outta luck. \r\n\r\nSo, instead, and especially on longer writeups/issues, I like to use VS Code to edit the issue text so I can save it. There are several good extensions (including the built-in markdown support) that allow me to preview the GFM markdown. \r\n\r\nYet, the one feature that I cannot seem to find is a way to view the issue comments/post a comment directly from VSCode. Instead, I have to open up the browser and copy/paste. While this isn't *horrible*, it sure would be nice to have the ability to directly interact with the contents of an issue from within VSCode. I think this extension could be a great place to do it -- doesn't have to be complex. \r\n\r\nJust a thought 😁 ",

Because the GH issues web interface does not have an automatic draft saving system (like Outlook/Exchange365/Office365 Word/Gmail), I'm outta luck. \r\n\r\nSo, instead, and especially on longer writeups/issues, I like to use VS Code to edit the issue text so I can save it. There are several good extensions (including the built-in markdown support) that allow me to preview the GFM markdown. \r\n\r\nYet, the one feature that I cannot seem to find is a way to view the issue comments/post a comment directly from VSCode. Instead, I have to open up the browser and copy/paste. While this isn't *horrible*, it sure would be nice to have the ability to directly interact with the contents of an issue from within VSCode. I think this extension could be a great place to do it -- doesn't have to be complex. \r\n\r\nJust a thought 😁 ",
