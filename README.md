# GitHub Issue Notebooks

The VS Code GitHub Issue notebook extension enables you to run issue queries from within VS Code so that queries and results are displayed interleaved - just like in other notebook applications. 

### Getting Started

1. Go to https://vscode.dev or use [VS Code Desktop](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
1. Install this extension from the market place: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-github-issue-notebooks
1. Select "File > New File... > GitHub Issue Notebook"

![Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-github-issue-notebooks/main/sample.png)

### Features

The following features are currently supported

* Querying and rendering of GH issues and PR queries
* Language Support
  * syntax highlighting
  * validation
  * completions
  * code navigation (find references, to go definition)
  * rename
  * formatting

### Query Syntax

This extension supports searching for issues and pull requests using GitHub search queries (https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests). In addition, variables can be defined and OR-queries can be used. Approximation of the grammar:

```
doc ::= query | or | def
query ::= <GH_QUERY>
or ::= query "OR" query | or
def ::= var "=" query
var ::= "$" [_a-zA-Z] [_a-zA-Z0-9]*
```

Note that new line characters always terminate an expression. 

#### Samples

A few sample queries from the vscode-project, paste each into a separate code cell

_Define variables for vscode and the current milestone (May 2020):_

```
$vscode=repo:microsoft/vscode 
$milestone=milestone:"May 2020"
```

_All current bugs I have created that are closed but not yet verified (using above variables):_

```
$vscode $milestone is:closed author:@me -assignee:@me label:bug -label:verified
```

_All issues that affect performance (startup, freezing, leakage):_

```
$vscode assignee:@me is:open label:freeze-slow-crash-leak
$vscode assignee:@me is:open label:perf
$vscode assignee:@me is:open label:perf-startup
```
